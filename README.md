	<h2>üî• How do I run this scrypt?</h2>
	<p>Simply download and run in powershell. It will need your admin password to work</p>
	<h2>üò± Is this a virus? Will this break my PC?</h2>
	<p>Not at all. This script is only 68 lines long. It's an open source project so you can look inside the code yourself but I am not responsible if anything breaks (it shouldn't tho). Use at your own risk</p>
	<h2>üÜò Window doesnt' show anything. Is it stuck? Should I forcefully stop the application?</h2>
	<p>Script includes some functions that take time to finish. Just leave the code be. Window of the script will close on it's own</p>
